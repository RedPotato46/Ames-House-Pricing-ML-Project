# Ames-House-Pricing-ML-Project

To undertake these tasks, we will be using a data set - Ames house pricing. This data set is a repository of all the houses that were sold in the Ames region in the USA.It has roughly 80 useful features describing the houses’ size, location, and various amenities offered. All these features go on to determine the selling price of the houses. This data set has been used extensively by machine learning enthusiasts and data scientists for projects on ‘house price prediction’. This data set, with its versatility and a good mix of numerical and categorical features, is a good data set to experiment on with multiple types of ML models. 

# Scenario

Predicting housing prices is of interest to potential buyers, sellers, and organizations alike. Multiple online platforms offer, for example, a free “price estimate” based on underlying machine learning models. For this assignment, we are going to build the best machine learning model we can for Ames, Iowa. The data set consists of 79 features that describe the quality and quantity of the properties to base our predictions.

This assignment aims to provide a glimpse of the process of model selection with 3 candidate models: 

Linear regression

Regression tree

k-NN model
